- research a python library that can connect to Postgres
- install the library using pip (or Pip Manager)
- create a connection object that connects to the database using the same credentials as the connection that you already use
- depending on what kind of library you choose, you either:
    - write SQL queries to get the data from the database,
    - or you use methods in the library that can do the same thing
- once you get the data, you check it is valid, then use it in the program
